      <description>A CLI Messaging App made with GoLang This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) messaging application written in Go. It allows users to send messages between each other, broadcast messages to all users, and view message logs.
You can run this on replit as well, here.
Key Components User Struct The User struct represents a user with a unique ID and their message log.
type User struct { ID int Log []string } Message Struct The Message struct represents a message with sender ID, receiver ID, and content.</description>

      <description>Have you ever checked the live score of any cricket match on google? I bet you have. And if you are a cricket fan, you would have noticed google offers a live win probability prediction for any cricket match. My inner child (and my 2rd yr Minor Project Deadline) motivated me to develop an end-to-end machine learning project using Python to predict the probability of an IPL cricket team winning a match given an instance of the match.</description>

      <title>Multi-Threaded Proxy Server</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/05_multithreaded_proxyserver/</guid>
      <description>This project is implemented using C and Parsing of HTTP referred from Proxy Server Project Theory Introduction How did we implement Multi-threading? Used Semaphore instead of Condition Variables and pthread_join() and pthread_exit() function. pthread_join() requires us to pass the thread id of the the thread to wait for. Semaphore‚Äôs sem_wait() and sem_post() doesn‚Äôt need any parameter. So it is a better option. Motivation/Need of Project To Understand ‚Üí The working of requests from our local computer to the server.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/04_tetris/</guid>
      <description>About the Project This project implements a Tetris game using Python with the added functionality of controlling the game using hand gestures detected from a webcam feed. The game utilizes the pygame library for graphics, cv2 for webcam access, and mediapipe for hand gesture detection. Players can control the movement of Tetris pieces by gesturing left, right, rotate, and fast-drop.
Control Flow Display the webcam feed using OpenCV. Dynamically adjust the fall speed of Tetris pieces based on gameplay time.</description>

      <description>Have you ever paused while using a &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; function on your computer and thought, &amp;ldquo;Is this truly random, or is my machine just pretending?&amp;rdquo;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the company of most people who haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a deep dive into this existential query. But today, we&amp;rsquo;re peeling back the layers of randomness to discover if our machines are indeed rolling the dice or just pulling a fast one on us.</description>
