<!-- #### [IPL Win Probability Prediction](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/ipl_win_predictor).  -->    
Have you ever checked the live score of any cricket match on google? I bet you have. And if you are a cricket fan, you would have noticed google offers a live _win probability_ prediction for any cricket match. My inner child (and my 2rd yr Minor Project Deadline) motivated me to develop an end-to-end machine learning project using Python to predict the probability of an IPL cricket team winning a match given an instance of the match.

# IPL Win Probability Predictor

## Summary

This project aims to revolutionize cricket prediction by leveraging data analytics, inspired by the principles highlighted in the movie "MONEYBALL." By employing machine learning techniques, it forecasts the win probability of IPL cricket matches, considering various crucial factors such as stadium conditions, target score, current run rate, overs played, and available wickets.

## About the Project

The IPL Win Probability Predictor is an end-to-end machine learning endeavor, meticulously designed to redefine cricket analysis through data-driven insights. It meticulously follows the Machine Learning Development Life Cycle to ensure robustness and accuracy in its predictions.

## Control Flow

The project's control flow spans various phases, including problem framing, data gathering, preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, deployment, testing, and optimization, ensuring a comprehensive approach to match prediction.

## Demo
