<!-- # MULTILABEL CAPEC CLASSIFICATION OF WEB-ATTACKS -->

This machine learning project focuses on the identification and classification of web attacks by leveraging advanced multilabel machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to categorize web attacks into Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of the threats posed to web applications. The project employs a diverse set of multilabel machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to Binary Relevance, Random Forest, Label Powerset, Multi-Output Classifier, and LightGBM. These algorithms are selected for their ability to handle the complex and interconnected nature of web attack patterns, allowing for a more nuanced and accurate classification of threats. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/webAttack_Classifier_ML-Model).

## About the Project

The project's goal is to develop a robust model for classifying web attacks based on the CAPEC framework. By employing various multilabel machine learning algorithms, the project aims to accurately categorize different types of web attacks, providing valuable insights for enhancing web application security.

5. **PreProcessing:** Prepare the data for model training by handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
6. **Encoding:** Encode categorical variables and preprocess text data if applicable.
7. **Model Training:** Train multilabel machine learning models using algorithms such as Binary Relevance, Random Forest, etc. 
8. **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune them as necessary.
9. **Pipelining:** Construct a pipeline for seamless data preprocessing and model training.
